PEP 8

modules (filenames) should have short, all-lowercase names, and they can contain underscores;
packages (directories) should have short, all-lowercase names, preferably without underscores;
classes should use the CapWords convention.

A Python module is simply a Python source file, which can expose classes, functions and global variables.
A Python package is simply a directory of Python module(s).
